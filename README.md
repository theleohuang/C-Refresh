# C-Refresh
C programming and algorithm implementations to refresh my C skills after a multi-year hiatus in Machine Learning and AI research.

Goals:
Rebuild fluency in basic C proficiencies such as pointer arithmetic and memory management
Practice data structures and algorithms
Prep for technical interviews and low-level programming roles
Complement High-Level ML knowledge with low-level implementation skills

Structure:
Each file is standalone and self-contained. No external libraries beyond standard C libraries.
Subject to change as needed. 

# Compile and Run

Use `gcc` to compile any file:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -o run two_sum.c
./run
